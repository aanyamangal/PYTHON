📌 Project Overview

Lecturers often spend time manually calculating student marks, averages, and grades.
This project helps automate the process by reading student scores, analyzing performance, and providing a formatted grade report.

The program allows: ✔ Manual entry of student names and marks
✔ Importing marks from a CSV file
✔ Statistical output (mean, median, min, max)
✔ Grade assignment (A–F)
✔ Pass/fail filtering
✔ Exporting results (optional)
